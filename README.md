# LoadPreFileWebApp
The application demostrates how a .pre file containing rainfall data can be processed and it's contents inserted into a SQL Server table
Simply enter in the full path name of the file and click the button to begin processing. On completion the results will be inserted into 
the dbo.Results table. All process information is written to the dbo.ResultsLog table which is displayed to the user

Some notes about the application
<ul>
  <li>File selection cannot be done by <i> input type='file' </i> as it only captures the fle name - not the full path</li>
  <li>Second line </li>
</ul>
